# twitterlists

Project Motivation and Goals:


1. Reduce time spent scrolling through feeds to find high important Tweets. Lists can help with this but have limited functionality and  streams can still be overwhelming if they have lots of users.

To do: 

1. Figure out how to retrieve more tweets from timeline. Max tweets to retrieve "count" paramater is set at 50 but unable to retrieve more than 17 tweets from Ethereum list, 25 from blockchain gaming.

2. Store tweet text and data in a database or data frame.

3. Identify most liked and retweeted tweets from a 24hr period.

3. Curate lists

4. Allow user to specficy list to lookup/get info from 

5. Send daily email with most popular tweets

6. Display most popular tweets on a webpage?
